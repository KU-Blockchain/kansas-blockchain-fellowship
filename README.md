# The Kansas Blockchain Fellowship

## About the Program

The Kansas Blockchain Fellowship is a seven-week experiential learning intensive, scholarship program, and talent incubator to prepare students in Kansas for careers in blockchain and web3. This program is designed to give exceptional students deep knowledge and experience around blockchain, digital assets, and web3 to prepare them for careers in the industry.

The deployed version of this website can be found at [https://kansasblockchain.org](https://kansasblockchain.org).

## A “Decentralized Canvas”

Not only is this web app a website for the program, but it has also functioned as a learning management system (LMS) for our fellows. After signing into the website on a token-gated login page, fellows had access to recordings of the lectures, supplemental materials, and a directory of mentors. The fellows could also visit the [portal](https://github.com/KU-Blockchain/kbf-app) to view their quiz feedback.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Heirloom](https://heirloom.io) for decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) for visual components

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
